# Granudrum-Analysis
To analyze images retrieved from experiments with the Granudrum of metal powders

The Granudrum instrument from Granutools is meant to characterize powder flowability using a dynamic approach. A metal cylinder with glass sides containing powder is placed inside a chamber that rotates the cylinder at various RPM and measures the dynamic angle of repose from the powder-air interface. These parameters correspond with flowability and spreadabillity in an AM machine. This current analysis is meant to extract features from the raw data and obtain meaningful results from the image dataset.
